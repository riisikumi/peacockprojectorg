Here's how to get up and running with Peacock.

-   Steps 4-5 need to be repeated every time you launch the game. Het spel zal anders terug gaan naar de officiÃ«le servers.

---

1. Be sure to check the [requirements](./requirements.md) before reading further to ensure you have the required games / operating systems. The **Microsoft Store version** of Hitman 3 **is not supported**, and [Linux users should check this page](../guides/linux-setup.md).

2. [Download the latest Peacock release here](https://github.com/thepeacockproject/Peacock/releases/latest). Select `Peacock-vX.Y.Z.zip` to download.

    - Note: There is also a `Peacock-vX.Y.Z-lite.zip` option, only for Linux users. Refer to the [Linux guide](../guides/linux-setup.md) for Linux instructions.

3. Extract (unzip) the files. Running the files while they're in the zipped folder won't work.

   - To avoid issues, **do not** put the extracted files in:
     - `Program Files` (including the x86 version)
     - The folder where your game is installed.
   - A great place to put them is somewhere easily accessible, like your Documents folder, or on your Desktop.

4. Go to the folder you put the files in, and run both `Start Server.cmd` and `PeacockPatcher.exe`.

5. Now start up the game while `Start Server` and `PeacockPatcher.exe` are still running. The game should launch with Peacock server. Check the [FAQ](./faq.md) or ask in the `#help` channel on [Peacock Discord](https://thepeacockproject.org/discord) if you have trouble getting it to work.

6. (Optional step) If you want to immediately unlock all weapons, items, starting locations, etc., [here's how](../intel/faq.md#how-to-get-all-items).

## Updating

Steps 2-3 may need to be repeated whenever Peacock receives an update (more info on the [Updating](./updating.md) page).
